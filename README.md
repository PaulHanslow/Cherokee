This repository consists of resources related to Cherokee type design.

### Contents
* **Word-o-Mat - Cherokee word list**<br>
Nina St√∂ssinger's [Word-o-Mat](https://github.com/ninastoessinger/word-o-mat) plugin for Robofont/Glyphs is a powerful plugin for making test words, yet it mostly covers Latin based languages. The CherokeeWordList.txt can be downloaded and imported as a custom file in Word-o-Mat for testing/proofing Cherokee glyphs within real words. The purpose of the CherokeeWordList is to accelerate proofing of Cherokee within Robofont/Glyphs without requiring to continually export an OTF to proof words in external  applications. Currently, only Uppercase Cherokee glyphs are supported. 

* **Cherokee pair frequency chart**<br>
Cherokee pair frequency chart listing which pairs occur more frequently. Can be helpful information for kerning, though it's recommended to kern all Cherokee letters to each other.
