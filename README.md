# Cherokee Type Design Resources
This repository consists of resources related to Cherokee type design.

### Contents
* **Word-o-Mat - Cherokee word list**<br>
Nina Stössinger's [Word-o-Mat](https://github.com/ninastoessinger/word-o-mat) plugin for Robofont/Glyphs is a powerful plugin for making test words, yet it mostly covers Latin based languages. The CherokeeWordList.txt can be downloaded and imported as a custom file in Word-o-Mat for testing/proofing Cherokee glyphs within real words. The purpose of the CherokeeWordList is to accelerate proofing of Cherokee within Robofont/Glyphs without requiring to continually export an OTF to proof words in external  applications. Currently, only Uppercase Cherokee glyphs are supported. 

* **Cherokee pair frequency**<br>
Cherokee pair frequency chart listing which pairs occur more frequently in the New Testament. Can be helpful information for kerning, though it's recommended to kern all Cherokee letters to each other.
