### Contents
* **Word-o-Mat - Cherokee word list** 
Nina Stössinger's Word-o-Mat plugin for Robofont/Glyphs is a powerful plugin for making test words, yet it mostly covers Latin based languages. The CherokeeWordList.txt can be downloaded and imported as a custom file in Word-o-Mat for testing/proofing Cherokee glyphs within real words. The purpose of the CherokeeWordList is to accelerate proofing of Cherokee within Robofont/Glyphs without requiring to continually export an OTF to proof words in external  applications. Currently, only Uppercase Cherokee glyphs are supported. 

* **Cherokee character frequency list** 
Cherokee letter frequency chart which lists the amount of times a letter appears on average.
